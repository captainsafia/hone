# Hone Setup Command - Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks
- Phase 1: Foundation - Module structure and CLI integration ✓
- Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (partial) ✓
  - Created `src/setup/detect.rs` for editor detection
  - Implemented PATH lookup utility
  - Implemented binary existence check
- Phase 3: Editor Implementations (partial) ✓
  - Helix editor setup fully implemented
    - Detection via PATH (`hx` or `helix`)
    - TOML config read/merge/write for `languages.toml`
    - Language server and file type configuration
    - Idempotent configuration (safe to run multiple times)
    - Unit tests for configuration logic
  - VS Code editor setup fully implemented
    - Detection via PATH (`code`) and platform-specific app locations
    - JSON config read/merge/write for `settings.json`
    - LSP configuration, file associations, and TextMate grammar
    - Idempotent configuration (safe to run multiple times)
    - Unit tests for configuration logic
    - Platform-specific config paths (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - Neovim editor setup fully implemented
    - Detection via PATH (`nvim`)
    - Auto-detects init.lua vs init.vim
    - Interactive LSP client selection (nvim-lspconfig, manual, coc.nvim)
    - Generates appropriate Lua or Vimscript configuration
    - Idempotent configuration with markers
    - Unit tests for configuration generation
    - Platform-specific config paths (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- CI/CD: Added VSCode extension build to release workflow ✓
  - Builds VSIX package on releases
  - Includes extension in GitHub releases
  - Properly sequences build jobs

## Current Status
- Helix setup is complete and functional
- VS Code setup is complete and functional
- Neovim setup is complete and functional
- Multi-editor error handling implemented
- Exit codes properly implemented (0 for success, 2 for errors)
- All tests passing (107 library tests, 18 binary tests, 10 integration test files)
- Code quality: No clippy warnings, properly formatted

## Next Priority Tasks
1. Implement remaining editors (Vim, Emacs, Sublime, Zed)
2. Add integration tests for setup command (challenging due to side effects)
3. Improve interactive prompts with better error handling
