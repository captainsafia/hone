    - Idempotent configuration (safe to run multiple times)
    - Unit tests for configuration logic
  - VS Code editor setup fully implemented
    - Detection via PATH (`code`) and platform-specific app locations
    - JSON config read/merge/write for `settings.json`

## Current Status
- Helix setup is complete and functional
- VS Code setup is complete and functional
- Neovim setup is complete and functional
- Vim setup is complete and functional
- Emacs setup is complete and functional
- Zed setup is complete and functional
- Sublime Text setup is complete and functional
- Multi-editor error handling implemented
- Exit codes properly implemented (0 for success, 2 for errors)
- PATH warning implemented (warns if hone binary not in PATH)
- All tests passing (107 library tests, 23 binary tests, 10 integration test files)
- Code quality: No clippy warnings, properly formatted
- All Phase 1-4 tasks complete (Foundation, Infrastructure, Editor Implementations, Command Integration)
